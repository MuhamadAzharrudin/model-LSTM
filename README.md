# LSTM(Long Short-Term Memory)-model

This repository contains an implementation of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model in Python using TensorFlow/Keras for time series prediction. LSTM is highly effective for modeling historical patterns such as temperature, stock prices, sensor readings, and more.

## 🧩 Key Features
- Flexible LSTM architecture.
- Data loader for input processing.
- Training (`train.py`) and evaluation (`evaluate.py`) scripts.
- Hyperparameter tuning via configuration.
- Performance metrics and visualization tools.

## Information
- 📌 Language: Python
- 📂 Released: July 2025
- ⚙️ Functionality: Model Training & Evaluation

## ⚙️ Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MuhamadAzharrudin/model-LSTM.git
