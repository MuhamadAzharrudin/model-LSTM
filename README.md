# LSTM(Long Short-Term Memory)-model

This repository contains an implementation of an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model in Python using TensorFlow/Keras for [task description: e.g., time-series forecasting, sentiment analysis, text classification, etc.].

## üß© Key Features
- Flexible LSTM architecture.
- Data loader for input processing.
- Training (`train.py`) and evaluation (`evaluate.py`) scripts.
- Hyperparameter tuning via configuration.
- Performance metrics and visualization tools.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MuhamadAzharrudin/model-LSTM.git
